lazy-load-bootstrap-carousel
============================

A lazy load version for the twitter bootstrap carousel.

A lazy load carousel delays loading of images in order to make the page load faster. 
It loads the images only if needed. It is useful for all web pages but mainly for web pages containing many large images.
Its behaviour is opposite of image preloading.

How to use
============================

You need to define the lazy-src="define your image path here" attribute for the images that must be loaded on demand.
I suggest using the lazy load feature from the second image. 

I created a simple example in the patch. It is useful to understand how to create your lazy carousel.
